House Price Prediction Model 🏡💰
This project implements a House Price Prediction Model using Random Forest to predict house prices based on various factors such as crime rate, number of rooms, property age, and more. The project includes key steps like data preprocessing, feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and the automation of predictions using a Pipeline.

🚀 Project Overview
This model predicts house prices based on a set of features. The workflow involves:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
Feature Scaling: Normalizing the data to ensure the model performs optimally.
Model Training: Using Random Forest to train the model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model's parameters to improve accuracy(GridSearchCV).
Pipeline: Automating the entire process from data preprocessing to prediction.

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
Python
Random Forest (from scikit-learn)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
scikit-learn (for machine learning models,tools and pipelines)
